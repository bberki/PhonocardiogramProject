# Phonocardiogram Project

This project is designed to process and analyze phonocardiogram signals from a `.wav` file, specifically targeting heart sound data for medical applications.

## Features

- **WAV File Signal Processing**: Reads `.wav` file data and processes the signal.
- **Signal Processing**: Includes basic signal manipulation (e.g., doubling the signal values).
- **Data Handling**: The project aims to read and interpret audio data for heart sound analysis.

## Currently Implemented

- WAV file reading functionality (though not fully complete).
- Basic signal processing (e.g., doubling the signal data).

## TODO

- **Signal Processing Enhancements**: The signal processing features are currently basic. Further processing techniques (e.g., frequency analysis, heart rate calculation, anomaly detection) are yet to be implemented.
- **GUI Implementation**: A graphical user interface (GUI) is not yet implemented.
- **WAV File Handling**: The complete `.wav` file reading and signal extraction process needs to be finalized.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/bberki/PhonocardiogramProject]
